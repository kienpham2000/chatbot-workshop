1. Go back to **Cloud9** service.

1. Create the S3 repo to store SAM artifact. Since the S3 repo name must be ***globally unique***, please postfix with your username
```
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket chatbot-workshop-[your-username]
```

1. Make sure you are in the **simple-api** directory
```
cd ~/environment/lambda-example/simple-api/
```

1. Package the template. Don't forget to replace `chatbot-workshop-[your-username]` with your actual S3 bucket name.
```
sam package --output-template-file template_packaged.yaml --s3-bucket chatbot-workshop-[your-username]
```

1. Deploy Lambda using SAM. This will take 1-2 minutes as SAM is creating CloudFormation stack. You will also see that there's a new S3 bucket created by SAM.
```
sam deploy --template-file template_packaged.yaml --stack-name chatbot-workshop-simple-api-lambda --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

1. Once Deployment is done, there will be a CloudFront url for your endpoint.

http https://xxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/
